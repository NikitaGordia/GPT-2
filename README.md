## Docker Usage

This project includes Docker support for easy setup and reproducible environments.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit (for GPU support)

### Available Services

1. **Training the model**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up train
   ```

2. **Processing data**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up data
   ```

3. **Running tests**:
   ```bash
   make docker-test
   ```

### Building the Docker image

```bash
docker compose build
```

### Custom commands

You can run any command in the Docker container:

```bash
